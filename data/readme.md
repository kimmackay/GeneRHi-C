raw reads were obtained from the original papers (GEO accession numbers listed below) and processed according to the methods outlined in Imakev 2012 (https://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v9/n10/full/nmeth.2148.html)

Note: the original s_pombe dataset used this method; the pipeline is available at: https://bitbucket.org/mirnylab/hiclib

Hi-C matrices (.matrix files) produced by the hiclib pipeline were converted into non-redundant, CSV adjacency matrices using the perl script (generate_adjacency_matrix.pl) in ../scripts/
