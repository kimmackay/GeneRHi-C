The following is a brief description of the contents of each folder:
	
	- data: contains the original s. pombe data and adjacency matricies that were used for step 1
	- step 1: contains the three mathematical models and their results
	- step 2: contains the script for generating the graph-representation from the reduced set of interactions
	  identified in step 1 and the results
	- step 3: contains the JYZ3D script for generating xyz coordinates and the results
